<h1>Basketball</h1>

<h2>Why Do I Like Basketball?</h2>

<p>Well i'm tall, so i can just 
rebound over anybody and i also like being on a 
team and working together and being able to stay
fit and not being lazy.Also making freinds is fun.We have a basketball court down at my neighborhood also so i don't have to drive to a gym or anything.It just sucks if it rains because it's outside</p>

<h2>Am I Any Good At Basketball?</h2>

<p>Well in all honesty im not good but 
I enjoy trying and improving to be better at the game.I like watching the pro NBA players play games.Also my step-brother taught me most of the stuff I know about basketball.But i did <a href="http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/nba/ankle-breaker.aspx">break one guy's ankles</a> down at the court.</p>

<h2>Who is your most hated NBA player?</h2>

<p>He plays for the golden state warriors,and his name rhymes with Reph Rurry. It's steph Curry and he sucks.He's the choke master and he plays the trashiest defense in the league.All he does on offense is shoot three's.Also trash lord aka. Steph Curry got his ankles broken so bad he actually got injured</p>
